# Fuzzamoto Intermediate Representation

At a high level, generic p2p testcases represent a sequence of actions
performed against one or more target nodes:

* Changing system time
* Establishing a new p2p connection
* Sending protocol messages on an established connection

Protocol messages in particular are highly structured, as they are serialized
using a [custom
format](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/serialize.h),
contain various cryptographic primitives (hash commitments, signatures,
checksums, ...) and must fullfil various other structural requirements to be
considered valid, such as:

* Block headers must point to a prior block via its hash
* Transaction inputs must point to existing unspent transactions outputs via
  transaction identifiers
* `blocktxn` messages are only processed if requested (after a prior
  `cmpctblock` message)
* ...

Therefore, naively fuzzing a scenario with a byte-array fuzzer, using the
following input format (with e.g.
[`Arbitrary`](https://github.com/rust-fuzz/arbitrary)) will mostly result in
fuzzing the message (de)serialization code and other easy to reach protocol
flows.

```rust
pub enum Action {
    SetTime { ... },
    Connect { ... },
    SendMessage { ... },
}

pub struct TestCase {
    pub actions: Vec<Action>,
}
```

If we want to focus on fuzzing deeper logic instead, then we'll need to make
input generation/mutation aware of the structural requirements. This is were an
intermediate representation, that holds relevant type and structural
information, becomes useful.

Fuzzamoto IR describes small programs that can be compiled into the simple
testcase format from above (`TestCase`). For the purpose of
mutation/generation, the fuzzer ([`fuzzamoto-libafl`](../usage/libafl.md))
operates on testcases encoded as the IR (as it contains relevant type and
structural information) and only compiles it to the simple format for target
execution.

## Design

Fuzzamoto IR consists of a sequence of operations that take some input
variables and produce variables as output. All variables are typed (see
[variables.rs](https://github.com/dergoegge/fuzzamoto/tree/master/fuzzamoto-ir/src/variables.rs))
and operations expect variables of compatible type. The IR uses static single
assignement form (SSA), which means every variable in the IR is assigned
exactly once. SSA helps simplify define-use analysis, type inference and code
generation/mutation among other things.

Each IR program is associated with a context that represents the snapshot state
of the test VM:

* Mock time
* Number of nodes
* Number of existing connections made by the scenario
* Available transaction outputs (Used for `LoadTxo` instructions)
* Available block headers (Used for `LoadHeader` instructions)

Programs might not be valid/useful in a different context. E.g. a program that
was generated within the context of 10 nodes and 200 connections might not be
valid in a context with 1 nodes and 8 connections, as it might refer to
non-existent nodes or connections.

In the following simple example, the IR describes the creation of a tx message
from raw bytes that is then send to a node via one of the existing connections:

```
// Context: nodes=1 connections=8 timestamp=1296688802
v0 <- LoadConnection(5)
v1 <- LoadMsgType("tx")
v2 <- LoadBytes("fefe8520fefefe0000fffffe8520")
SendRawMessage(v0, v1, v2)
```

*Note that this is a human readable representation and not the internal
in-memory structure used by the fuzzer.*

This example would compile into a single `TestCase::SendMessage` operation.

The next example is more complex and better demonstrates the strengths of the
IR:

```
// Context: nodes=1 connections=8 timestamp=1296688802
v0 <- LoadBytes("5656565656565656567a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7a7aa9ffff5656567a506464649b64596464f16463646464")
v1 <- LoadTxo(083666c9bf066f9d3a28ad30f5c0ed6fe463f7777e033783875b2523ef5214bb:0, 2500000000, 00204ae81572f06e1b88fd5ced7a1a000945432e83e1551e6f721ee9c00b8cc33260, , 51)
v2 <- LoadConnection(4)
v3 <- LoadTxVersion(2)
v4 <- LoadLockTime(144)
BeginBuildTx(v3, v4) -> v5
  BeginBuildTxInputs -> v6
    v7 <- LoadSequence(4294967295)
    AddTxInput(v6, v1, v7)
  v8 <- EndBuildTxInputs(v6)
  BeginBuildTxOutputs(v8) -> v9
    BeginWitnessStack -> v10
    v11 <- EndWitnessStack(v10)
    v12 <- BuildPayToWitnessScriptHash(v0, v11)
    v13 <- LoadAmount(100000000)
    AddTxOutput(v9, v12, v13)
  v14 <- EndBuildTxOutputs(v9)
v15 <- EndBuildTx(v5, v8, v14)
v16 <- TakeTxo(v15)
v17 <- LoadLockTime(508195987)
v18 <- LoadTxVersion(2)
BeginBuildTx(v18, v17) -> v19
  BeginBuildTxInputs -> v20
    v21 <- LoadSequence(4294967294)
    AddTxInput(v20, v16, v21)
  v22 <- EndBuildTxInputs(v20)
  BeginBuildTxOutputs(v22) -> v23
    v24 <- LoadBytes("51")
    BeginWitnessStack -> v25
    v26 <- EndWitnessStack(v25)
    v27 <- BuildPayToWitnessScriptHash(v24, v26)
    v28 <- LoadAmount(98500000)
    AddTxOutput(v23, v27, v28)
  v29 <- EndBuildTxOutputs(v23)
v30 <- EndBuildTx(v19, v22, v29)
SendTx(v2, v30)
SendTx(v2, v15)
```

Two transactions are build (`v15`, `v30`), that are then send to the node under
test through connection `v2`. `v15` spends from an output in the snapshot state
`v1` (loaded by `LoadTxo`). The relationship between the two transactions (i.e.
`v30` is the parent of `v15`) is encoded in the IR through the use of
variables. `v16` (output of `TakeTxo`) represents the output created by `v15`
and is added to `v30` via the `AddTxInput` instruction in the `BuildTxInputs`
block. `v30` is sent before `v15` potentially triggering 1P1C logic.

This example would compile into two `TestCase::SendMessage` operations,
containing the correctly serialized transactions `v15` and `v30`.

### Mutators

Several mutation strategies are available for IR programs:

- `InputMutator`: Replaces an instruction's input variable with another
  variable of compatible type. This mutation aims at changing the dataflow of a
  given program by making an instruction operate on a different value.
- `OperationMutator`: Mutate an operation, e.g. mutate the input values of a
  `Load*` operation. 
- `CombineMutator`: Insert an entire IR program into another one at a random
  location. This mutation aims at changing a program's control flow by
  combining two programs into one.
- `ConcatMutator`: Append an entire IR program to another one at a random
  location. This mutation aims at changing a program's control flow by
  appending another program to it.

Generators offer further mutation strategies that involve the generation of new
programs or new instructions into existing programs. They can be used to
bootstrap an initial corpus as well as to mutate existing inputs during a
fuzzing campaign. The following generators are available:

- `SendMessageGenerator`: Generates a new `SendRawMessage` instruction
- `AdvanceTimeGenerator`: Generates new `AdvanceTime` and `SetTime`
  instructions
- `CompactFilterQueryGenerator`: Generates new `SendGetCFilters`,
  `SendGetCFHeaders` and `SendGetCFCheckpt` instructions
- `BlockGenerator`: Generates instructions to build a block
- `HeaderGenerator`: Generates instructions to build a header
- `AddTxToBlockGenerator`: Generates instructions to add a transaction to a
  block
- `OneParentOneChildGenerator`: Generates instructions for building two new
  transactions (a 1-parent 1-child package) and sending them to a node

### Minimizers

Minimizers are used to reduce the size of an interesting program (e.g. bug or
new coverage). The following minimization strategies are available:

- `Nopping`: Attempt to nop out instructions in an effort to reduce the size of
  a program.
- `Cutting`: Attempt to cut out instructions of the end of a program in an
  effort to reduce the size of a program.
- `BlockNopping`: Attempt to nop out entire blocks of instructions in an effort
  to reduce the size of a program (e.g. nop all instructions between and
  including `BeginBlockTransactions` and `EndBlockTransactions`).
