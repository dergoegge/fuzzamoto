# Reproducing Testcases

Crashing or other interesting inputs can be reproduced without the snapshotting
VM, by building the scenario binary without the nyx feature and supplying it
the input either through `stdin` or the `FUZZAMOTO_INPUT` environment variable.

Ensure scenarios are build without the nyx feature:

```
cargo build --release --features inherit_stdout,reduced_pow --workspace
```

`--features inherit_stdout` is used to inherit stdout from the target
application, such that any logs, stack traces, etc. are printed to the
terminal.


## `http-server` example

Run the scneario with the input supplied through `stdin` and pass the right
`bitcoind` binary:

```
cat ./testcase.dat | RUST_LOG=info ./target/release/scenario-http-server ./bitcoind
# Use "echo '<input base64>' | base64 --decode | ..." if you have the input as a base64 string
```

Or alternatively using `FUZZAMOTO_INPUT`:

```
FUZZAMOTO_INPUT=$PWD/testcase.dat RUST_LOG=info ./target/release/scenario-http-server ./bitcoind
```

## Troubleshooting

* Make sure to not use the nyx feature or else you'll see:
  ```
  ...
  Segmentation fault (core dumped)
  ```

* If you see the following output, try killing any left over `bitcoind`
  instances or retry reproduction until it works:
  ```
  ...
  Error: Unable to bind to 127.0.0.1:34528 on this computer. Bitcoin Core is probably already running.
  Error: Failed to listen on any port. Use -listen=0 if you want this.

  failed to create client: Io(Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: "No such file or directory" })
  ...
  ```

* If an input does not reproduce, check that you are compiling with all
  necessary features relevant for your case, such as `compile_in_vm`,
  `force_send_and_ping` and `reduced_pow` (always recommended). Also check that
  `bitcoind` was build with all required patches applied (see
  [target-patches/](https://github.com/dergoegge/fuzzamoto/tree/master/target-patches)
  and [Patches](./target-patches.md)).

* If the input still does not reproduce (e.g. `bitcoind` does not crash), the
  crash might be non-deterministic. Have fun debugging!
