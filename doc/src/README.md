# Fuzzamoto

Fuzzamoto provides a framework and fuzzing engine for coverage-guided fuzzing
of Bitcoin full node implementations.

* **Implementation Agnostic**: The same tests can target different protocol
  implementations and compare their behavior (e.g. [Bitcoin
  Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin),
  [btcd](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd),
  [libbitcoin](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin), ...)
* **Holistic**: Tests are performed on the full system, not just isolated
  components, enabling the discovery of bugs that arise from the composition of
  different components
* **Coverage-Guided**: Fuzzing is guided by coverage feedback

*It is not meant to be a replacement for traditional fuzzing of isolated
components, but rather a complement to it.*
